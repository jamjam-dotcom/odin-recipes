    <h1>Adobo</h1>
    <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_adobo#/media/File:Adobo_DSCF4391.jpg" alt="Chicken Adobo on a serving plate">    
    <p>The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. The various precolonial peoples of the Philippine archipelago often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt in various techniques to preserve them in the tropical climate. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with the main traditional types being coconut, cane, nipa palm, and kaong palm. These are all linked to traditional alcohol fermentation</p>
